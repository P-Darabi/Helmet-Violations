# Helmet Violation Detection with License Plate Recognition

## Overview
This project detects and tracks helmet violations in video footage and extracts license plate numbers of violators using YOLO and PaddleOCR. It provides annotated output videos and a text file containing detected license plate numbers for further analysis.

## Features
- **Helmet Violation Detection**: Identifies motorcyclists not wearing helmets using YOLO.
- **License Plate Recognition**: Extracts license plate information using PaddleOCR.
- **Annotated Video Output**: Generates a video with bounding boxes around violators and their license plate numbers displayed.
- **Structured Output**: Saves license plate details in a text file.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is hosted on Kaggle: [Helmet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/helmet/data). It contains annotated images for training and validating the detection model.

## Prerequisites
### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries (install using `requirements.txt`):
  - `torch`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `Pillow`, `matplotlib`, `paddleocr`
- YOLO weights for helmet detection.

### Hardware Requirements
- A GPU-enabled machine for faster processing is recommended.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/helmet-violation-tracker.git
   cd helmet-violation-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the YOLO weight file (`best.pt`) in the `yolo-weights/` directory.

4. Install PaddleOCR:
   ```bash
   pip install paddleocr
   ```

## Usage
1. Place the input video file in the `videos/` directory.
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Output:
   - The processed video will be saved as `result.mp4`.
   - License plate numbers will be stored in `output/plate_numbers.txt`.

## Example Output
- **Annotated Video**: Bounding boxes around violators and their license plate numbers.
- **Text File**:
  ```plaintext
  Detected Plate Numbers:
  ABC1234
  XYZ5678
  ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add real-time detection from live video feeds or CCTV.
- Enhance OCR accuracy for challenging conditions.
- Create a web-based dashboard for analytics.
