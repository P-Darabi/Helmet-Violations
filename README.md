# Object Detection and Tracking for Helmet Violations

## Overview
This application detects and tracks individuals riding motorcycles or scooters without helmets in video footage. It also extracts license plate information of violators using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The application provides a real-time visual display of violations and outputs structured data for further analysis.

## Features
- **Helmet Violation Detection:** Uses YOLO or similar pre-trained object detection models to identify individuals not wearing helmets.
- **Object Tracking:** Tracks detected vehicles and riders across video frames using tracking algorithms like SORT or DeepSORT.
- **License Plate Recognition:** Extracts license plate information from violating vehicles using Tesseract OCR or similar libraries.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Displays the video with bounding boxes around violators and overlays extracted license plate numbers.
- **Structured Output:** Saves violation details (e.g., license plate numbers, timestamps) in a CSV or JSON file for record-keeping or further processing.

## Prerequisites
### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - numpy
  - torch
  - torchvision
  - pytesseract
  - matplotlib
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) or any similar object detection framework.
- Tesseract OCR installation for license plate recognition.

### Hardware Requirements
- A GPU-enabled machine is recommended for faster object detection and tracking.
- Sufficient storage for input video files and output results.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/helmet-violation-tracker.git
   cd helmet-violation-tracker
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Tesseract OCR:
   - **Ubuntu:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     Download and install Tesseract from [Tesseract OCR GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

4. Download YOLO weights:
   - Obtain pre-trained YOLO weights from the [YOLO website](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) or use a compatible object detection model.

## Usage
1. Place your input video files in the `videos/` directory.
2. Run the application using the command line:
   ```bash
   python main.py --input videos/sample_video.mp4 --output results/
   ```
3. The application will:
   - Process the video to detect and track helmet violations.
   - Display the video with bounding boxes and license plate information in real-time.
   - Save the extracted violation details in the specified output directory.

## Example Output
- **Video Playback:** The processed video displays bounding boxes around violators and prints the extracted license plate number below the frame.
- **CSV Output:** Example of violation details stored in `results/violations.csv`:
  ```csv
  Frame, License Plate, Violation
  12, ABC1234, No Helmet
  45, XYZ5678, No Helmet
  ```

## Future Enhancements
- Enable support for live video feeds from cameras or CCTV.
- Deploy as a web-based or mobile application for broader accessibility.
- Improve OCR accuracy for challenging scenarios such as poor lighting or occlusions.
- Add a reporting dashboard for summarized violation statistics.
